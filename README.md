# C Utilities

## Description

This repo is for personal learning and practice.  The utilities created could be useful in a future embedded project, but for now I'm primarily using this repo to learn the SCons build tool and integration with ThrowTheSwitch's Unity testing framework.

## Dependencies
 * [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) or [SCons](https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-build-install) (depending on the branch)
   * [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) (when using SCons)
 *  [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (for Unity scripts)

## Building

### CMake

```
./build.sh
```

### SCons

```
scons
```
